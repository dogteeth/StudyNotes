#### CloudKit Idea
- Assets can only exist as attributes on records.
- Retrieving assets can nagatively impact performance.
- Deleting a record will also delete any associated assets.

#### Create Relationships
 
#### CloudKit main elements
- Objects: CKRecord = NSManagedObject in CoreData
- Models: Schema = NSManagedObjectMode in CoreData
- Stores: CKRecordZone / CKDatabase = NSPersistentStore in CoreData


#### Create a persistent store.
